<h1>HTML: Building Tables</h1>
<h2>Setting Table Attributes</h2>
<p>Prior to HTML5, the &lt;table&gt; element had a number of attributes that primarily assisted with the presentation of the tablular data. These attributes are no longer part of the HTML specification, but will continue to be supported by almost all user agents for backwards compatibiity purposes. While not recommended as part of the authoring process, knowing how the <strong>border</strong>, <strong>cellpadding</strong>, <strong>cellspacing</strong>, and <strong>width</strong> attributes work is important for understanding legacy code, or for when styles are not available.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td>Tag</td>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;table&gt;</td>
    <td>Table</td>
    <td>Identifies what follows as a table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;tr&gt;</td>
    <td>Table Row</td>
    <td>Establishes a new row within the table</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;th&gt;</td>
    <td>Table Header</td>
    <td>Identifies the contents of a cell as being a header for a group of cells</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;td&gt;</td>
    <td>Table Cell</td>
    <td>This element defines the individual table cells of an element</td>
  </tr>
</table>

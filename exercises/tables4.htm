<h1>HTML: Building Tables</h1>
<h2>Adding Table Captions</h2>
<p>Often, you may need to identify the contents of a table by giving it a title. While this can be accomplished by using a heading element prior to the table, a more sematic way would be to use a table caption. Captions are added to tables immediately after the opening table tag by using the &lt;caption&gt; element. Captions can be as complex as you need them to be, and can even contain formatted text and images. For the most part, however, captions should be brief and descriptive. </p>
<p>Although past versions of HTML contained attributes to position captions, they have been deprecated in HTML5 and all visual formatting of captions should be controlled through CSS.</p>
